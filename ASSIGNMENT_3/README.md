# About
NetMan is a network management system used to monitor, manage, and optimize the performance of the network infrastructure. It uses SNMP to discover and poll details about networking devices such as routers, switches, and access points, servers, controllers, and even end devices to ensure that they operate efficiently. This tool will allow network engineers to manage and troubleshoot the network infrastructure's individual components within a larger network management framework, ensuring a healthy and error-free network environment.
