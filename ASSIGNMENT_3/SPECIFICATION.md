# NetMan_System Specifications

## Project Title
NetMan_System

## Domain
### IT & Networking
The IT & Networking domain focuses on engineering, managing, and securing communication networks across the whole enterprise. It includes technologies and protocols for monitoring, configuring, and troubleshooting the network infrastructure, ensuring reliable data transmission, security, and optimal performance.

## Problem Statement
Organizations face challenges in monitoring network health, detecting failures, ensuring optimal performance and maximum uptime. This network management tool serves to provide real-time monitoring, alerting, and data visualization to improve network reliability. This will save organizartions much time, as many of the processes and services can be automated for maximised efficiency. The NetMan_System also provides a user-friendly interface through which network administrators and engineers can interact with the networking system hardware. Enterprises need their IT and Networking teams to have full information and control of the business's computer network environment, in order to facilitate the smooth operation of the business in pursuit of their corporate objectives.

## Individual Scope (Feasibility Justification)
This project is feasible because it utilizes ubiquitous good quality technologies that can sustain the enterprise network over the long-term, along with well-documented implementation frameworks for aligning the technology to business requirements.
### Tools and features that justify feasibility for this project:
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/index.html) for automated network configuration
- [SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-configuration-manager?CMP=KNC-TAD-BNG-SW_E_X_PP_CPC_LD_EN_PBOS_X-SCM&gad_source=1) for compliance checks, backups, and configuration management
- [SolarWinds Orion](https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion) for network health performance, uptime and performance analytics
- [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/) for collecting network performance data in real-time
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for storing network logs and historical configuration data

### Project Limitations
- Due to time constraints, we will not be able to integrate AI for error detection, but will use rule-based scripting instead with SNMP alerts and SolarWinds pattern detection and log analysis
