# About
NetMan is a network management system used to monitor, manage, and optimize the performance of the network infrastructure. It uses SNMP to discover and poll details about networking devices such as routers, switches, and access points, servers, controllers, and even end devices to ensure that they operate efficiently. This tool will allow network engineers to manage and troubleshoot the network infrastructure's individual components within a larger network management framework, ensuring a healthy and error-free network environment.

# Domain
This tool is designed for IT practitioners and experts in their repective enterprises. Specifically, it will prove most useful to network engineers, administrators and managers who interact with at least some of the components of the network on a regular bases to guarantee maximum uptime and facilitate business processes.









Yes, mentioning **domain experts** and **stakeholders** is crucial when working with network management software, especially if you are aiming to develop a system that accurately meets real-world needs. Identifying the **domain** is equally important to ensure you are focusing on the right problem space and to guide the design and development of the software.

Let’s break it down:

### 1. **Identifying the Domain**
   - **The domain** in network management software refers to all the areas and activities the software will address, like monitoring, configuration, performance management, security, troubleshooting, etc. By identifying the domain, you clarify the **problem space** the software is supposed to solve.
   - **Why it’s important**: Knowing your domain helps you focus on the key features, set priorities, and ensure the software's design aligns with the needs of the network you're managing.

### 2. **Domain Experts**
   - **Domain experts** are individuals with deep knowledge and expertise in the specific areas that the software targets. For network management software, domain experts may include:
     - **Network Engineers**: These are experts in the design, configuration, and management of networks. They will provide insights into network behavior, the devices involved, and best practices for network performance.
     - **System Administrators**: They are often responsible for configuring and maintaining servers and infrastructure, so their input is critical for understanding the network's environment.
     - **Security Specialists**: These experts focus on the security aspects of the network, ensuring data is protected, firewalls are correctly configured, and intrusion detection systems are functioning.
     - **IT Operations Managers**: They understand the larger business context of the network. They are interested in high-level metrics, troubleshooting, and ensuring uptime and availability for business continuity.

   - **Why it’s important**: Working with domain experts ensures that you build a software solution that truly addresses the needs of the network and business. They can help you validate requirements, identify pain points, and suggest practical solutions.

### 3. **Stakeholders**
   - **Stakeholders** are people or groups who have a vested interest in the success of the software, even if they aren’t directly involved in the day-to-day technical aspects. For network management software, stakeholders may include:
     - **Business Leaders/Managers**: They are concerned with how the network supports business operations, such as uptime, reliability, and the cost of managing the network. They want high-level visibility into the network’s performance and reports.
     - **End Users**: These could be employees, customers, or anyone using the network’s services. While they might not be directly involved in managing the network, their experience with the network (speed, availability, reliability) is important.
     - **IT Support Teams**: They will use the software to troubleshoot and resolve network issues. Their feedback is crucial for improving the user experience of the software.
     - **Vendors/Third-Party Service Providers**: If your network management software is integrated with or uses third-party services (like cloud hosting or managed services), these providers may be stakeholders, as their performance impacts the network.

   - **Why it’s important**: Identifying stakeholders helps ensure that the software meets both the technical and business needs. Engaging stakeholders from the start can help avoid costly misalignments later in the project.

### In Summary:
Yes, it’s definitely a good idea to:
- **Identify the domain** (network management, security, performance, etc.) to focus the development efforts.
- **Mention who the domain experts are** (network engineers, security specialists, etc.) to ensure that the software reflects real-world practices and needs.
- **Identify the stakeholders** (business leaders, IT support teams, end users) to make sure the software aligns with broader organizational goals and is usable by those who interact with it.

By understanding both the domain and the key people involved, you can develop network management software that is both technically effective and aligned with the needs of its users.
