### **Reflection: Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs**  

Working as both the **developer and stakeholder** in the NetMan_Sys project presented unique challenges, particularly in **prioritization, effort estimation, and aligning Agile principles with project needs**. Since there were no external stakeholders to provide feedback, the decision-making process relied entirely on internal assessment, which often led to **conflicting perspectives** and **self-imposed resistance**.  

#### **Challenges in Prioritization**  
The first challenge was determining which features were truly **"Must-have"** for the MVP versus those that could be postponed. Initially, there was a temptation to include too many functionalities in **Sprint 1**, assuming that features like **performance reports** and a **dashboard with analytics** were immediately necessary. However, prioritization required a **disciplined approach**, focusing only on what was essential for basic **network monitoring, user authentication, and alert notifications**. Letting go of additional enhancements and trusting that they could be addressed in future sprints required a **shift in mindset**.  

#### **Challenges in Estimation**  
Effort estimation was particularly difficult due to **uncertainty in implementation complexity**. While some tasks, like **setting up role-based access control**, seemed straightforward, others—such as **real-time network monitoring**—involved unforeseen technical dependencies. Assigning **story points** required balancing **optimism** and **realism**, ensuring that estimates reflected both **development effort and potential bottlenecks**. Since no team discussions or peer reviews were available, self-assessment was prone to over- or underestimations. The **Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)** was used to categorize tasks by complexity, helping structure a more realistic **sprint workload**.  

#### **Challenges in Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs**  
Being the sole stakeholder meant there was **no external validation** of priorities. Normally, Agile relies on **user feedback and stakeholder engagement**, but in this case, decisions were based purely on **internal evaluation**. This led to occasional doubts—was the system truly meeting user needs, or was it being shaped by personal biases? To compensate, I simulated a **stakeholder mindset**, imagining real-world network administrators' challenges and aligning priorities accordingly.  

#### **Lessons Learned**  
Throughout this process, I realized that **restraint is key** when defining the scope of Sprint 1. Initially, I was inclined to include too many features, but I learned that prioritization requires focusing on essential functionalities while trusting that additional enhancements can be implemented in future sprints. **Effort estimation proved to be more complex than expected**, as some tasks appeared simple but had hidden dependencies that could extend development time. Using the Fibonacci sequence for story points helped create a structured approach, but without external validation, I had to rely on self-assessment, which introduced the risk of over- or underestimation. Additionally, I found that **aligning Agile practices with stakeholder needs required a shift in perspective**—since I was both the developer and stakeholder, I had to detach from personal biases and think critically about what would provide the most value to end users. This experience reinforced the importance of **iterative development**, ensuring that the MVP delivers core functionality while leaving room for continuous improvement in future sprints.
