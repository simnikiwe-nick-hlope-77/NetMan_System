### USER STORY CREATION
We converted the [functional requirements](https://github.com/simnikiwe-nick-hlope-77/NetMan_System/blob/master/ASSIGNMENT_4/Functional%20Requirements.md) from Assignment 4 and the [use cases](https://github.com/simnikiwe-nick-hlope-77/NetMan_System/blob/master/ASSIGNMENT_5/Use%20Case%20Specifications.md) from Assignment 5 into user stories.
