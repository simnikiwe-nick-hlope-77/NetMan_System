# Reflection on Kanban

Using Kanban has taught me that instead of focusing on managing individual tasks, teams can actually focus on completing them instead, since the workflow is automated. Using Kanban in the **NetMan_System** project has shown how an organized workflow can help minimize overhead. 

By automating task movement and providing a clear visual representation of progress, Kanban reduces the need for constant manual updates and frequent status meetings. One important lesson is the role of Work in Progress (WIP) limits in preventing slowdowns. By capping the number of tasks being worked on at any time, Kanban encourages the team to prioritize finishing tasks rather than juggling multiple assignments. 

Additionally, the clear visibility of tasks helps ensure that everyone knows what to work on next, reducing delays and confusion. Another key advantage is Kanbanâ€™s ability to reduce context switching. When team members constantly shift between tasks, productivity drops.

Looking ahead, adding more automation features such as issue tracking and priority-based task movement could further streamline the workflow and boost team productivity. Overall, this experience highlights that Kanban is more than just a task management system; it is a powerful method for optimizing workflows and minimizing unnecessary overhead in Agile development.
