Automated Kanban helps teams work more efficiently by keeping tasks organized and reducing manual updates. In Agile, work should flow smoothly from one stage to the next. With automation, tasks move automatically when certain actions happen. For example, when a team member is assigned a task, it moves from To Do to In Progress. When the task is completed and closed, it moves to Done without needing to be moved manually.

Agile teams use different stages like Backlog, Sprint, In Progress, Review, and Done to track their work. Automation keeps everything updated so teams always know what needs to be done next.

Since tasks update automatically, everyone can see what is happening without needing to ask or update the board themselves. This reduces confusion and helps team members stay accountable for their work.

Automation also helps teams react quickly to problems. If a task that was marked as "Done" needs more work, it can automatically move back to To Do so the team knows to fix it. This makes it easier to adjust plans and keep improving, which is an important part of Agile.
