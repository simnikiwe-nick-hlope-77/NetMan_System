# Definition and purpose of Kanban

Kanban is an industry-standard agile project management tool that helps teams visualise their work and spread their issues through customisable columns to represent workflow stages. It limits overhead by minimizing unnecessary tasks, such that new tasks cannot be added until pending tasks in progress are completed. This increases work efficiency. Through visual presentation of real-time progress, the need for frequent meetings is reduced, since the progress is visible.
