# Functional Requirements for NetMan_System  

## **1. User Authentication & Authorization**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall allow users to register and log in with unique credentials.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Users must be able to log in using a username and password, with role-based access control (e.g., admin, network engineer, operator).  

## **2. Device Monitoring**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall provide real-time monitoring of all network devices, including routers, switches, and servers.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Device status updates should refresh every 5 seconds, displaying metrics such as uptime, CPU usage, and bandwidth consumption.  

## **3. Alerting & Notifications**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall generate alerts for network anomalies (e.g., high latency, device failure).  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Alerts must be sent via email and dashboard notifications within 10 seconds of detection.  

## **4. Network Topology Visualization**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall display an interactive network topology map.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Users must be able to click on a device to view its status and logs.  

## **5. Device Configuration Management**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall allow authorized users to apply and roll back configurations on network devices.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Changes must be logged, and users should have the option to revert to a previous configuration.  

## **6. Performance Reporting**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall generate performance reports for network health, bandwidth usage, and incident history.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Reports must be exportable in PDF and CSV formats.  

## **7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall enforce role-based access restrictions.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Admins can manage user roles, and non-admin users should have limited access to sensitive network configurations.  

## **8. Remote Device Control**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall allow authorized users to reboot or shut down network devices remotely.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Users must confirm actions before execution, and logs should capture all remote commands.  

## **9. Network Traffic Analysis**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall analyze and display network traffic patterns and detect potential bottlenecks.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Traffic data should update every 30 seconds, with trend visualization over time.  

## **10. Audit Logging & Activity Tracking**  
- **Requirement:** The system shall log all user actions for auditing purposes.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Logs must capture timestamps, user IDs, and actions performed, and they should be searchable by admins.
