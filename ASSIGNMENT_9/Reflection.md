# REFLECTION
---
Designing the domain model and class diagram provided me with a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of domain modeling and its application in the context of a real-world network management system. The task involved identifying key entities, their attributes, and the relationships among them within the **NetMan_System**â€”a system designed to streamline network operations, diagnostics, and user support.

Through this assignment, I gained practical experience in analyzing system requirements and translating them into a **Class Diagram**, a core component of object-oriented analysis and design. I identified essential classes such as `NetworkDevice`, `Administrator`, `IncidentReport`, `DiagnosticTool`, and `UserSession`, each with appropriate attributes and methods that reflect their real-world behavior within the network.

Creating the domain model helped clarify the structure of the system, its various components and their interactions with each other. I learned the importance of distinguishing between **domain concepts** and implementation details. This modeling process made it easier to identify redundancies, enforce consistency, and plan for future scalability.

Overall, this assignment reinforced the value of domain modeling as a bridge between abstract requirements and technical implementation. It has given me more confidence in designing software systems that are logically organized, maintainable, and aligned with real user needs. The class diagram now serves as a blueprint for future development stages of the NetMan_System.
