# Reflection: Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs  

Balancing stakeholder needs in the development of **NetMan_System** presented several challenges, including:  

1. **Conflicting Priorities:**  
   - Network administrators prioritized **security and control**, while end-users emphasized **usability and accessibility**. Finding a middle ground required designing **a secure system with a user-friendly interface**.  

2. **Performance vs. Scalability:**  
   - Ensuring real-time monitoring for thousands of devices while maintaining a **responsive system** was challenging. Optimizing database queries and implementing **efficient data caching** helped address this issue.  

3. **Security vs. Convenience:**  
   - Enforcing **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** improved security but added complexity for users. A compromise was made by allowing **adaptive MFA**, where users could remain logged in on trusted devices.  

4. **Customization vs. Maintainability:**  
   - Stakeholders requested **custom features per department**, which could complicate system updates. A modular approach allowed flexibility while keeping **core functionalities standardized**.  

5. **Budget Constraints:**  
   - Advanced security features, such as **AI-driven anomaly detection**, were desirable but costly. A balance was struck by **prioritizing essential security measures** while planning for future enhancements.  

6. **Regulatory Compliance vs. System Agility:**  
   - Ensuring **compliance with data protection laws** (e.g., GDPR) introduced constraints on **data storage and processing**. Implementing **role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption** helped meet compliance while maintaining system efficiency.  

### **Conclusion**  
Successfully balancing stakeholder needs required **constant communication, iterative design, and trade-offs** between usability, security, performance, and cost. A structured **requirement prioritization framework** ensured that essential functionalities were delivered without compromising long-term system maintainability.
